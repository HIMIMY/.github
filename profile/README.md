# HIMIY

If you are known to be able to find your way around business technology, you have probably been asked to receommend software.

This is how my conversations go:
- Them: "What software should I use for business process management? I need library checkout software, a ticketing system, fill in the blank."
- Me: "I recommend Chaimy (HIMIMY)."
- Them: "How do you know it is the best?"
- Me: "How? I Made It MYself!"

I have never been happy with any of the libary management systems, ticket/work management tools, and other business management systems out there.
I have no idea if anyone else will find these to be useful, but I say the best ticketting system is definitely the one you write yourself.

## About the Name

> There are two hard problems in programming: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

How do you find a name that is pronouncable and where the GitHub organization name is available?
You think up tons of initials and sort of mess with the pronounciation until it works.

HIMIMY is pronounced Chaimy, a nickname for the hebrew name Chaim.
